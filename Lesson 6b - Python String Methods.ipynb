    "\n",
    "Over this lesson you’ve learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "- .upper(), .title(), and .lower() adjust the casing of your string.\n",
    "- .split() takes a string and creates a list of substrings.\n",
    "- .join() takes a list of strings and creates a string.\n",
    "- .strip() cleans off whitespace, or other noise from the beginning and end of a string.\n",
    "- .replace() replaces all instances of a character/string in a string with another character/string.\n",
    "- .find() searches a string for a character/string and returns the index value that character/string is found at.\n",
    "- .format() allows you to interpolate a string with variables.\n",

    "Well I’ve been stringing you along for long enough, let’s get some more practice in!\n",
