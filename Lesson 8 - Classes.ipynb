After we defined a certain class, when we want something to be considered as that class we created (again, think about str(), int(), etc) , we need to tell python that “this is SomeClass”, so we “instantiate” it and make it an “instance” of that class so that this something later falls under this class and can be applied with various methods we created in the class block.\n",
